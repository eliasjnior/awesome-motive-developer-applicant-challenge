# Todo list

Some improvements can be made to the application. Here are some of them:

[ ] Add PHP_CodeSniffer to the project to act like an ESLint to PHP
[ ] Add PHP Unit Tests and create mocks to test the `src/core` implementation
[ ] Add comments to create documentation
[ ] Create a script to build the plugin and pack into a zip, removing unnecessary files
